                <div class="col-sm-6"><p>Born Abel Tesfaye on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Canada, the Weeknd has become one of the music industry's leading alternative R&B performers. He is the son of Ethiopian immigrants but has had little contact with his father, who left the family when the Weeknd was only a toddler. His early musical influences ranged from traditional Ethiopian music to the "King of Pop," Michael Jackson.  The Weeknd’s earlier mixtapes were re-released as 2012’s Trilogy, which became a platinum-selling record for the young artist. Despite his growing popularity, he managed to hide himself from the public at large. Some of the mystique he built around himself was intentional, but it also reflected the shyness and insecurities that troubled him early in his career. In addition to his own work, the Weeknd collaborated with other artists. </p>
</div>
                <div class="col-sm-6"> <p> He also earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song, also for "Earned It." In late November 2016, the Weeknd released his third album, Starboy. Along with guest appearances by Lana Del Rey, Future and Kendrick Lamar, the studio effort prominently featured French electronic duo Daft Punk, who collaborated on the chart-topping title track and its follow-up single, "I Feel It Coming."
The following year, the Weeknd reciprocated some of the guest contributions by appearing on albums for Lana Del Rey and Future. In early 2018, it was announced he would headline the two-weekend Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, along with Beyoncé and Eminem.Shortly afterward, the artist took home the Best Urban Contemporary Album Grammy for Starboy.
